The c++ program defines a class named "car" with attributes like brand, model, and year.
Created three objects (carobj1, carobj2, carobj3) of the "car" class representing different cars.
Assigned values to the attributes (brand, model, year) of each car object.
Printed out the attribute values using cout statements to display the brand, model, and year of each car.
Demonstrated the use of classes, objects, and attributes in C++ effectively.
